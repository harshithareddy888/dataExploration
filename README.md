# dataExploration
- Overview
- 
This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL Server.
The script (DataExploration1.sql) performs queries and aggregations on two datasets:

- newCovidDeaths – contains information on COVID-19 deaths by location, date, and population.

- covidVaccinations – contains data on vaccinations administered across countries/regions.

The goal is to analyze infection trends, death rates, and vaccination progress at both global and country levels.
